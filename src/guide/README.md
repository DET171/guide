# Introduction

[Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) is a lightweight Node.js library for interacting with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). Larger bots tend to use Eris instead of [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), as Eris is smaller in size and faster. Discord.js covers 100% of the Discord API, but that also means is uses more memory and bots using it tend to have performance issues when they go big. <br>
However, the fact that Eris doesn't cover 100% of the Discord API is nothing to worry about. For example, you can `require` the buttons directly from the `discord.js` package, but for Eris, you can't. Still, there is absolutely no need to worry! The community has come up with NPM packages like [discord-buttons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-buttons). <br>
So, if you've read until here and decided that you still want to learn Eris, you can proceed to the next section.
