# Databases
A lot of Discord bots use databases to store information. For example, take Dank Memer. It uses databases to store how much money a user has and what items he has in his inventory. Another great example is Carl bot, a Discord moderation bot. it uses SQLite3 and other databases to store the user's wrongdoings and warns, then kick or ban the user when he gets too much warns. <br>
Databases seem quite useful, don't they? There are a lot of choices of databases, but I'm just going to list a few:
- [quick.db](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quick.db) *"An easy, non-locking, persistent better-sqlite3 wrapper designed to be easy to setup & utilize"*
- [sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) *"Multi dialect ORM for Node.JS"*
- [enamp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) *"A simple database wrapper to make sqlite database interactions much easier for beginners, with additional array helper methods."*
- [keyv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv)*"Simple key-value storage with support for multiple backends"*
