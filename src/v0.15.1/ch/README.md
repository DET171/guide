# Third-party command handlers
If you're feeling a bit tired or lazy, and don't want to code your own command handler, that's perfectly fine! You can just use some command handlers provided by the community. <br>
Here are a few that the Eris Support Server recommends:
- [Chariot.js](https://chariot.js.org/)
- [Yuuko](https://eritbh.me/yuuko/)
- [Patron](https://github.com/LJNeon/patron)
- [Eris Boiler](https://alex-taxiera.github.io/eris-boiler/)
