# Introduction

[Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) is a lightweight Node.js library for interacting with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). Larger bots tend to use Eris instead of [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), as Eris is smaller in size and faster. Discord.js covers 100% of the Discord API, but that also means is uses more memory and bots using it tend to have performance issues when they go big. <br>
However, the fact that Eris doesn't cover 100% of the Discord API is nothing to worry about. For example, you can `require` the buttons directly from the `discord.js` package, but for Eris, you can't. Still, there is absolutely no need to worry! The community has come up with NPM packages like [discord-buttons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-buttons). <br>
So, if you've read until here and decided that you still want to learn Eris, you can proceed to the next section.

::: warning
This tutorial is for `v0.15.1` of Eris, which does not yet support `interacticonCreate` and interactions. According to Discord, verified bots (bots in 100 or more servers) can no longer access message information and content, and can only use slash commands. However, if your bot is in less than 100 servers, this version is still ok for you. For large bots (verified bots, bots in more than 100 servers), message content will become a Privileged Intentâ€”like presence and guild member data. <br>
NOTE: Bots in less than 100 servers will not be affected at all.<br>

(Coming into effect April 2022, by when there will probably be a new version of Eris)
