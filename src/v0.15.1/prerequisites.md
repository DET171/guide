# Prerequisites
There are a few prerequisites before you can start writing a Discord bot with Eris.

## System Prerequisites
- Have Node.js (14.x, recommended LTS) installed
- NPM 7.x.x (if not, run `npm i -g npm`)
- Yarn (optional, replaces `npm i` with `yarn add`. Run `npm i -g yarn` to install it)
- A web browser

If you don't have Node.js installed, head over <a href="./Getting%20started.html#installing-node-js">here</a> to check how to install it.

## Knowledge
We assume, of course, that you have a good knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js.
If not, you can learn about JavaScript here:
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_intro.asp)
- [MDN's JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Google](https://google.com/)

Take your pick, learn some JavaScript, and once you feel like you're confident enough to make a bot, come back and get started!
